# ncurses_tetris
This is just a fun little project I wrote to learn some Rust. If you want to play clone this repository and then run cargo build --release.
Put the binary in your PATH so you can play whenever you get bored.  
  
Warning: Tetris is highly addictive and should only be played in moderation.
